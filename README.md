##ezRPG 1.2.1.10 | Active Development

###Warning this version of ezRPG 1.2.1 has substantial code changes from it's previous version (1.0.x). If you are upgrading, make sure you've checked and tested all modules to make sure they conform to the new code.

=====

This engine is destined to be part of the ezRPG legacy 1.x series started by Zeggy. For the new, reimagined version implementing the great new offerings of PHP5, a true MVC structure, PSR-0 compliant, and Smarty-Less, check out ezRPG 2.x series when that development is ready for public release!
