/*
  Function: shorten
  Shortens a text to a specified length.

  This will keep shortening the text until it finds a space, so that it won't cut off words.

  Parameters:
  $text - The text to shorten.
  $length - The number of characters the text must be shortened to.

  Returns:
  The shortened text, or the full text if the text was already short enough.

  Example Usage:
  > $str = 'blablabla long string here';
  > $new_str = shorten($str, 15);
  > echo $new_str;
  > //Outputs: 'blablabla long...'

            --$length;
        }
        $ret = substr($text, 0, $length);
        $ret .= "...";

        return $ret;
